# computeIPP
script for computing ionising photons produced given surface temperature and luminosity of a star

calculates ionising photon production rates for photons capable of ionising hydrogen, helium I and helium II

can be edited to read arrays of temperature and luminosity to give ionising photon production over the evolution of a star or stars
